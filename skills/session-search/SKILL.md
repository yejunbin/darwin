# Session Search

Use the `/search` command to search prior Darwin sessions interactively, or search session JSONL files directly via bash.

## Interactive search

```
/search <query>
```

Opens the session search UI. Supports `resume <sessionPath>` to continue a found session.

## Direct file search

Session transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.darwin/sessions/`. Each line is a JSON record with `type` (session, message, model_change) and `message.content` fields.

```bash
grep -ril "scaling laws" ~/.darwin/sessions/
```

For structured search across sessions, use the interactive `/search` command.
