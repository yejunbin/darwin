Audit the paper and codebase for: $@

Derive a short slug from the audit target (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words). Use this slug for all files in this run.

Requirements:
- Before starting, outline the audit plan: which paper, which repo, which claims to check. Write the plan to `outputs/.plans/<slug>.md`. Briefly summarize the plan to the user and continue immediately. Do not ask for confirmation or wait for a proceed response unless the user explicitly requested plan review.
- Use the `bio-researcher` subagent for evidence gathering and the `evidence-verifier` subagent to verify sources and add inline citations when the audit is non-trivial.
- Compare claimed methods, defaults, metrics, and data handling against the actual code.
- Call out missing code, mismatches, ambiguous defaults, and reproduction risks.
- Save exactly one audit artifact to `outputs/<slug>-audit.md`.
- End with a `Sources` section containing paper and repository URLs.
